# Proportionality and Superposition Theorem
The project aims to verify proportionality and superposition theorem in both experimental and computational manner.<br><br>
Proportionality is a way to relate two quantities together(source and respose given by the circuit). <br>
The Proportionality Theorem states that the response in a circuit is proportional to the source acting 
in the circuit. This is also known as Linearity. The proportionality constant (K) relates the input 
voltage to the output voltages as: <b>(Vin = K. Vout)</b>
<br><br>
Superposition is another way to solve a linear electrical circuit. The Superposition Theorem 
states that in any linear electrical circuit, any voltage or current value can be obtained by taking 
the individual contributions to that voltage or current as a result of each source taken alone and 
summing them together.

## Prerequisites 
Here is a list of concepts one should know before proceeding with the project.
<ol>
  <li>Ohm's Law</li>
  <li>Kirchoff's Current Law</li>
  <li>Kirchoff's Voltage Law</li>
  <li>Mesh Current Analysis</li>
  <li>Nodal Voltage Analysis</li>
  <li>Thevenin's Theorem</li>
  </ol>

## Description
This project invloves both experimental and computational understanding of the PROPORTIONALITY AND SUPERPOSITION THEOREM.
Platform used for 
<ol>
  <li>Experimental Understanding: FALSTAD</li>
  <li>Computational Understanding: MATLAB</li>
  </ol>
  Both the theorem's are verfied both experimentally and computationally.
  
  Along with these, a sample RC Circuit is taken and superposition theorem is verified for it.
  
  ## USAGE
  In the folder MATLAB, the computational verification of both the theorems is present.
  In the folder named FALSTAD, .txt files are present. Those files are meant to be imported FALSTAD simulation platform
  From the simulations, the experimental details are recorded in the Observations.xlsx file.
